Homework#7 - Professional README Generator

## what did I do?

This assignment included making a node application (with Inquirer) that will assist the user in creating a README.md file. The user can launch the application, answer the questions presented to them, and enjoy the README.md file that is generated for them after answering the final question.

## what do I need to explain

You will see two README.md files in this repo. The one you are reading (yes, this one) is describing this project. The other README.md file is located in the 'readmes' folder. This additional README.md file is the one gernerated by the application.
